# Classic Arcade Game - Frogger
This game is a project part of the [Front-end Web Developer nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) with Udacity and Google.  
Here's my other [projects for fend](https://inacarine.github.io/fend).

## Instructions
To play the game, head over to this link: https://inacarine.github.io/fend-classic-arcade-game-clone/

Or you can:
1. **Download the files:** click the 'clone or download' button and chose to download the game as a ZIP file. You then need to unzip the files so you can open the index.html file in your preferred browser. You are then good to go!
2. **Using git:** You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. In the command line, run this command `$ git clone https://github.com/InaCarine/fend-classic-arcade-game-clone.git`, and the files will be cloned to your computer. When finished, open the index.html in your browser.

## Objective
The aim of the game is to get past all the bugs and arrive safely by the water. The player gets three ‚ù§Ô∏è(lives) which will be lost if hit by any of the bugs, and 5 points will also be taken away from the score. There are also üíé(gems) in three different colors, which gives different points, that can be collected.

So basically, try and collect as many gems as possible before reaching the water! If all lives are lost, the game is over!

## How to play
Select the character you want to play with and hit start! To move the character around use the arrow keys:

- left
- right
- up
- down

### Enemies üêû
The enemies comes in from the left, and there's one in each of the rows with pavement. The speed they move at is generated at random. When they leave the screen, their position gets reset so they will come back from the left. They will take a life from the player if hit.

### Gems üíé
The gems gets placed at random and comes in three different color. The colors and points they give are:
- Blue - gives +5
- Green - gives +10
- Orange - gives +20

The blue gem got a 50% chance to show, the green 30% and the orange 20%.

### Timer ‚è±Ô∏è
The game got a timer, in the top right corner, that shows how long the player use to complete the game.

### Score
In the top center of the game is where the score is being tracked. This gets increased when the player collects gems or decreased if they hit an enemy.

## Resources
All the assets were provided for me by Udacity except for the game menus, which I created myself.
